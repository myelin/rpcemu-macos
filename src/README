Building on Linux
-----------------

A basic automake/auoconf framework exists, though the install
capability requires a bit of work.

To use:
  $ aclocal
  $ automake
  $ autoconf
  $ ./configure
  $ make

Currently RPCemu looks for configuration and roms relative to
it's executable image, so you'll need to copy the resultant
binary to the top-level directory with:

  $ cp rpcemu ../

Execute as normal with:
  $ cd ../
  $ ./rpcemu
