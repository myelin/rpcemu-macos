Building on Linux
-----------------

A basic automake/autoconf framework exists, though the install
capability requires a bit of work.

To use:
  $ ./configure
  $ make

Currently RPCEmu looks for configuration and ROMs relative to
its executable image, so you'll need to switch to the top-level
directory with:

  $ cd ..

Execute as normal with:

  $ ./rpcemu
