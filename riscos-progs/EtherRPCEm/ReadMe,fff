These files are used for setting up networking on RPCEmu.

Please refer to the guide at

http://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/manual/network.html

for full instructions on how to configure networking.

These two directories need to be merged (dropped over the top of) with the
directories inside your !Boot. !System is normally !Boot.Resources.!System
and Autosense varies depending on which version of RISC OS is used; use the
RISC OS filer to search for it.

Remember you will also need to have the Castle 32bit SharedCLibary
installed for these to work. See the guide for more details and the URL.
