# RPCEmu macOS builds

This is Phillip Pearson's fork of [RPCEmu](http://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/).  It contains the latest 0.9.1 code, plus Timothy Coltman's macOS patches, and some scripting to produce useful builds.

## Releases

[Binary releases in .dmg format can be found here](https://github.com/myelin/rpcemu-macos/releases).  These are experimental, but have been verified to work by several people so far.

If these work for you -- and especially if they don't! -- please leave a note on the Stardot discussion thread or RPCEmu mailing list (see links below).

## Bug tracker

[Report bugs on the GitHub issue tracker here](https://github.com/myelin/rpcemu-macos/issues).

## Development

If you're interested in helping out with RPCEmu, there is developer information on the [main RPCEmu homepage](http://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/).  You're also welcome to submit pull requests directly to this repository, but unless they're just to the build tooling (build_macos_*.sh), please also start a thread on the RPCEmu mailing list.
